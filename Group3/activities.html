        <p>In Australia there are many activities that we could take part in, such as hiking, eating delicious new food, sky diving, visiting interesting locations, and enjoying the tropical areas of the country. </p>
        <head>Hiking!</head>
        <p>
         Hiking is a nice activity to do to get out into the landscape of Australia, and whilst hiking one may even spot a kangaroo, though it's generally a good idea to keep away as I've heard that they can be somewhat agressive.

        <head>Food!</head>
        <p>
         There are many species that are unique to Australia, and so it bears to reason that there may be many unique foods to try as well, and who doesn't like food?

        In australia there are also many unique locations to visit as well, such as the city of Sydney, the Holden Museum (dedicated to Holden, a car company native and exclusive to Australia), the coast and Great Barrier Reef that lies offshore.
