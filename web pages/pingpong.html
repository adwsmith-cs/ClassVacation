        </h1>
        <p>In Wii Sports Resort's Ping Pong, you win by scoring points and reaching a two-point lead, either to 6 points or 11 points (by holding the 2 button during setup). A serve starts the rally; the ball must bounce once on your side before you return it to the opponent's side. You lose a point if you miss the ball, hit it off the table, hit it before it bounces (unless it's a volley), touch the table with your free hand, or hit the ball twice. The serve switches every two points.</p>
