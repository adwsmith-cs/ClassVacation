    <p>One of the many activities at the Wii Sports resort is Sword Fighting.</p>
    <p>During this activity your goal is to knock your opponant off the high rise platform. Once you knock your opponant off you get a point. </p>
    <p>This game is played best out of 3, so once you win two rounds you win the entire event.</p>
    <p>During the daytime there are regular matches, and during the evening there are higher level matches.</p>
    <p>Depending on your level you can also get different armor suits.</p>
